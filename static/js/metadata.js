A few variants of physics are used, please see the metadata field named comment. Comparing to physics #1 : physics #2 adds melt ponds; physics #3 uses 60 atmospheric levels instead of 31; physics #4 also, and adds a stratospheric chemical scheme ; physics #5 integrates biophysical coupling between phytoplankton and light penetration into the ocean as described in Lengaigne et al;, 2009",
